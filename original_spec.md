1. Overview

Purpose:
The Git Game Show is an application that transforms a project’s Git commit history into a live, multiplayer trivia game. One user hosts a session, other players join remotely, and the system automatically rotates through rounds of different question-based “mini-games,” awarding points and declaring a final winner.

2. Key Stakeholders
	1.	Host: The person who initiates and controls the game session.
	2.	Players: Individuals who join an ongoing game session to compete.

3. High-Level Functionality
	1.	Hosting a Game
	•	The system must allow a user to create a new game session.
	•	The system must provide a way to specify a password or passphrase for joining.
	•	The system must generate or display an address/port (or equivalent connection info) that other players can use to connect.
	•	The system must load or access Git repository data (commit information) so that questions can be generated from that data.
	2.	Joining a Game
	•	The system must allow other users to connect to the host’s game session by providing the session’s address/port and password.
	•	The system must reject join attempts when an incorrect password is used or the session is unavailable.
	3.	Lobby / Pre-Game Phase
	•	The system must place new players in a “lobby” state while awaiting the game’s start.
	•	The system must communicate each player’s successful entry to the host.
	4.	Gameplay Rounds
	•	The system must organize the game into discrete rounds.
	•	Each round must feature one “mini-game” (or question category) that defines:
	•	How many questions it will present in that round.
	•	The scoring rules for correct/incorrect or partial answers.
	•	The style of questions (multiple choice, sorting, fill-in, etc.).
	•	The system must randomly (or in a configurable sequence) select mini-games for each round.
	•	The system must handle a fixed or configurable total number of rounds.
	5.	Mini-Games
	•	Each mini-game must produce questions derived from the Git commit data (such as commit authors, messages, dates, etc.).
	•	Each mini-game must define its own:
	•	Number of questions in the round.
	•	Question format (e.g., multiple choice vs. puzzle).
	•	Time limit per question (if applicable).
	•	Points awarded for correct responses.
	•	The system must ensure that every player receives the question content simultaneously.
	•	The system must collect each player’s response and evaluate correctness, awarding points accordingly.
	6.	Scoring & Leaderboard
	•	The system must maintain a scoreboard that tracks points per player.
	•	The system must update and display scores after each question or after each mini-game round.
	•	The system must handle tied scores in a consistent manner (e.g., reflect them in the leaderboard).
	7.	Timing & Flow Control
	•	The system must allow for a timeout or deadline for each question if not all players have answered.
	•	After finishing a mini-game’s questions (a complete round), the system must provide a short transition or “break” before proceeding to the next round.
	8.	End of Game
	•	The system must conclude the session after a specified number of rounds (or an optional time limit).
	•	The system must display a final scoreboard and declare a winner (the highest score).
	•	The system must release or close all connections or offer the host an option to restart a new game.

4. Non-Functional Requirements & Constraints
	1.	Usability
	•	The system must present clear instructions for hosting or joining the game.
	•	The system must display explanatory text, help, or ASCII-based welcome screens to orient the user.
	2.	Performance
	•	The system must be able to handle multiple players connecting over a network with minimal latency for question broadcasts and answer submissions.
	•	The system must complete each round in a reasonable timeframe, given time limits per question.
	3.	Security
	•	The system must restrict joining a session via a password mechanism.
	•	The system must safeguard against unauthorized or malformed attempts to join.
	4.	Scalability
	•	The system should accommodate a small-to-moderate number of players (exact upper limit depends on usage scenario but typically under ~50).
	5.	Reliability
	•	The system must handle disconnections gracefully (e.g., if a player loses connection mid-round, that player’s response is counted as missing, and the round proceeds).
	6.	Portability
	•	The system must be deployable in a typical developer environment that has access to a Git repository, so it should not require specialized hardware.

5. Detailed Functional Requirements

Below are specific statements of required functionality:
	1.	Hosting & Session Creation
	•	FR-1: The system shall allow a user (Host) to initiate a game session within a Git repository context.
	•	FR-2: The system shall allow the host to define a password or passphrase that players must use to join.
	•	FR-3: The system shall display a session identifier (address/port or similar) for other players to connect.
	2.	Player Joining
	•	FR-4: The system shall prompt each joining player for the session address and the session password.
	•	FR-5: The system shall reject join attempts if the password is incorrect.
	•	FR-6: The system shall confirm each player’s successful join to both the host and the player.
	3.	Lobby & Start
	•	FR-7: The system shall maintain a pre-game lobby until the host triggers the start of the main game.
	•	FR-8: The system shall indicate to all players when the game is starting.
	4.	Mini-Game Rounds
	•	FR-9: The system shall group questions into rounds, each round dedicated to a single mini-game type.
	•	FR-10: Each mini-game type shall define a specific number of questions to be asked in its round.
	•	FR-11: Each mini-game type shall use data from the Git commit history to generate its questions.
	5.	Questions & Answers
	•	FR-12: The system shall broadcast each question to all connected players simultaneously.
	•	FR-13: For each question, the system shall collect answers from all players within a specified time limit.
	•	FR-14: If players do not respond by the time limit, their answer shall be treated as incorrect or zero points (as defined by mini-game rules).
	•	FR-15: The system shall calculate correct/incorrect responses based on the mini-game’s logic, then update each player’s score accordingly.
	6.	Scoring & Leaderboard
	•	FR-16: The system shall maintain a cumulative score for each player across all rounds.
	•	FR-17: After each question or at the end of each round (depending on mini-game design), the system shall broadcast an updated scoreboard to all players.
	•	FR-18: The scoreboard shall display at least each player’s name or identifier and total points.
	7.	Round Transitions
	•	FR-19: After completing the set of questions in a round, the system shall transition to the next round or mini-game type automatically or with a brief delay.
	•	FR-20: The system shall allow a short “break” or transition screen before the next round begins, optionally displaying comedic or informational messages.
	8.	Game Completion
	•	FR-21: The system shall end the game after a predetermined number of rounds (or an optional overall time limit).
	•	FR-22: The system shall display a final scoreboard and announce the winner (the highest-scoring player).
	•	FR-23: The system shall provide the host and players with a clear indication that the session is over, and optionally allow the host to start a new session.

6. Possible Extensions (Optional Scope)
	•	FR-O1 (Teams): Optionally, the system could support team-based play where players join teams, and the scoreboard tracks team scores rather than individual.
	•	FR-O2 (Question Skins/Themes): The system could offer configurable question templates or “themes” to change how the questions are displayed or described.
	•	FR-O3 (Advanced Security): The system could offer encrypted connections, user authentication, or rate-limiting for join attempts.
	•	FR-O4 (Persistent History): Optionally store each session’s final scoreboard, so the host can compare results between games.

7. Constraints & Assumptions
	1.	Local Git Repository: The host’s machine must have a valid .git repository for the system to parse commit data.
	2.	Network Accessibility: Players must be able to connect to the host’s machine via a shared network or an internet-accessible endpoint.
	3.	Time Synchronization: Exact timing for question deadlines should accommodate latency variations; the system can rely on a basic server-defined clock for all timeouts.
	4.	Maximum Players: The system design should remain performant for small to moderate groups (e.g., 2–20 players) without requiring specialized hardware.

8. Success Criteria
	1.	Engaging Gameplay: Players can successfully host or join a session, answer questions, and track scores in real time.
	2.	Data-Driven Questions: The system successfully leverages commit author, date, message, or other Git metadata as the basis for unique questions.
	3.	Stable Multiplayer: The game runs without crashes or data corruption for the duration of a typical multi-round session.
	4.	Fairness & Accuracy: The system accurately scores correct/incorrect answers and updates the scoreboard accordingly.
	5.	Completed Sessions: Multiple test sessions can be hosted and finished without major technical or usability issues.
